Install node.js

And Node10.js

when you use scss, you don't have to write in css.
You can make easier time-changing changes in scss.
Those changes will be translated into the css language in the css stylesheet of your project.

these changes will be directored into the chosen css stylesheet file through terminal


When you use terminal instead of git use npm

Examples:

npm status
npm push
npm fetch origin master
npm reset hard origin/master
